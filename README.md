Discount_Calculator
===================

This discount calculator uses test-driven-development to ensure a viable calculator for determining percentage and absolute discount amounts. The various tests assert percentage and absolute values. By doing this, it has helped me refactor the code in a way that handles percent inputs, absolute inputs, and ValueErrors.
